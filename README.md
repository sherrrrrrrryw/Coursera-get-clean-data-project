# Coursera-get-clean-data-project
This project includes the following files:

`CodeBook.md` is a codebook containing all the variables and dataset used the project.

`run_analysis.R` is the project performing data cleaning following the steps described as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`Final.txt` is the output data after cleaning with the `run_analysis.R` project.
